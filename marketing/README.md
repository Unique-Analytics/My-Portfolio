## Product Title 
Audience Profile Map

## Business Drivers and Significance
This Audience Profile Map was designed based on a request that i recieved from a customer. They wanted to know the demographics and the audience social makeup for a specific DMA(Demographics Marketing Area). DMA's are used by most marketing companies and marketing departments within a company to understand a specific regions audience profile. They then utilize this information in order to target specific region(s) that match a certain profile. Most DMA reports out there only have very basic information such as gender, age, race, etc, but don't assist in understanding the customer an their enviroment and their surroundings which are the things that influence their buying habits. 

I did provide them with this information, but i could not find any one source or dataset that i could use to provide them with a report. So I ended up doing a custom report but it took quite sometime to research and attain the data, but it got done.  At that point i knew there was a need and based on my research decided to fullfill that need in the form of an Audience Profile Map, that includes detail demographics, lifestyle and environment data by geographic DMA as well as Facebook DMA.


## Implementation Process
1. First i located multiple sites that contain demographics, lifestyle, environment, facebook data that i wanted to include in my dataset. 90% of the data i found was unstructured data.
2. Once i located the sites, i began to create various scripts that would scrape, clean and prepare the dataset for visualization in a map application.
3. I then created the scripts that were needed to join the data from the different sites into one dataset.
4. There were a few external datasets i had to integrate into the final dataset. One being a longitude and lattitude dataset.
5. So the final datset was exported to .csv and then used in my visualization application to which i use internally for my business. 

Now when customers request this informaton, it only takes me a matter of minutes to fulfill their request.
